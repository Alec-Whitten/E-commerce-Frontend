        <p>We are one of the many factories who produced battle droids during the horrific clone wars.
          Our droids held off waves of skilled soilders during the war and they are ready to do the
          same for your buisness. They may not have won the war for the trade federation, but they can win 
          the war to keep your buisness safe.
        </p>

        <div class = "gap"/>

        <p>Disclaimer: we are not responsible for any military action taken by a company with our droids.
          This includes uprisings and silencing protest with violence.
